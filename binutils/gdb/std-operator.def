   Note this is used by C++, but not C.  The C parser handles local
   static variables in the parser directly.  Also, this is only used
   in C++ if the function/method name is not quoted, like e.g.:

     p S:method()::var
     p S:method() const::var

   If the function/method is quoted like instead:

     p 'S:method() const'::var

   then the C-specific handling directly in the parser takes over (see
   block/variable productions).

   Also, if the whole function+var is quoted like this:

     p 'S:method() const::var'

   then the whole quoted expression is interpreted as a single symbol
   name and we don't use OP_FUNC_STATIC_VAR either.  In that case, the
   C++-specific symbol lookup routines take care of the
   function-local-static search.  */
