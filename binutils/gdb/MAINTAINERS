		GDB Maintainers
		===============


		   Overview
		   --------

This file describes different groups of people who are, together, the
maintainers and developers of the GDB project.  Don't worry - it sounds
more complicated than it really is.

There are four groups of GDB developers, covering the patch development and
review process:

  - The Global Maintainers.

    These are the developers in charge of most daily development.  They
    have wide authority to apply and reject patches, but defer to the
    Responsible Maintainers (see below) within their spheres of
    responsibility.

  - The Responsible Maintainers.

    These are developers who have expertise and interest in a particular
    area of GDB, who are generally available to review patches, and who
    prefer to enforce a single vision within their areas.

  - The Authorized Committers.

    These are developers who are trusted to make changes within a specific
    area of GDB without additional oversight.

  - The Write After Approval Maintainers.

    These are developers who have write access to the GDB source tree.  They
    can check in their own changes once a developer with the appropriate
    authority has approved the changes; they can also apply the Obvious
    Fix Rule (below).

All maintainers are encouraged to post major patches to the gdb-patches
mailing list for comments, even if they have the authority to commit the
patch without review from another maintainer.  This especially includes
patches which change internal interfaces (e.g. global functions, data
structures) or external interfaces (e.g. user, remote, MI, et cetera).

The word "contributor" is used in this document to refer to any GDB
developer listed above as well as folks who may have suggested some
patches but aren't part of one of those categories for any reason.

There's also a couple of other people who play special roles in the GDB
community, separately from the patch process:

  - The Official FSF-appointed GDB Maintainers.

    These maintainers are the ones who take the overall responsibility
    for GDB, as a package of the GNU project.  Other GDB contributors
    work under the official maintainers' supervision.  They have final
    and overriding authority for all GDB-related decisions, including
    anything described in this file.  As individuals, they may or not
    be generally involved in day-to-day development.

  - The Release Manager.

    This developer is in charge of making new releases of GDB.

  - The Patch Champions.

    These volunteers make sure that no contribution is overlooked or
    forgotten.

Most changes to the list of maintainers in this file are handled by
consensus among the global maintainers and any other involved parties.
In cases where consensus can not be reached, the global maintainers may
ask the official FSF-appointed GDB maintainers for a final decision.

The term "review" is used in this file to describe several kinds of
feedback from a maintainer: approval, rejection, and requests for changes
or clarification with the intention of approving a revised version.
Approval is a privilege and/or responsibility of various positions among
the GDB Maintainers.  Of course, anyone - whether they hold a position, but
not the relevant one for a particular patch, or are just following along on
the mailing lists for fun, or anything in between - may suggest changes, ask
questions about a patch or say if they believe a patch is fit for upstreaming!

To ensure that patches are only pushed when approved, and to properly credit
the contributors who take the time to improve this project, the following
trailers are used to identify who contributed and how.  The trailers (or tags)
currently in use are:

 - Tested-By:

   Used when a contributor has tested the patch and finds that it
   fixes the claimed problem.  It may also be used to indicate that
   the contributor has performed regression testing.  By itself, this
   tag says nothing about the quality of the fix implemented by the
   patch, nor the amount of testing that was actually performed.

   Usage: "Tested-By: Your Name <your@email>"

 - Acked-By:

   Used when a responsible or global maintainer has taken a superficial
   look at a patch and agrees with its direction, but has not done further
   review on the subject.
   This trailer can be specific to one or more areas of the project, as
   defined by the "Responsible maintainers" section of this file.  If
   that is the case, the area(s) should be added at the end of the tag in
   parenthesis in a comma-separated list.

   Usage: "Acked-By: Your Name <your@email> (area1, area2)"

 - Reviewed-By:

   Used when a contributor has looked at the code and agrees with
   the changes, but either doesn't have the authority or doesn't
   feel comfortable approving the patch.
   This trailer can be specific to one or more areas of the project, as
   defined by the "Responsible maintainers" section of this file.  If
   that is the case, the area(s) should be added at the end of the tag in
   parenthesis in a comma-separated list.

   Usage: "Reviewed-By: Your Name <your@email> (area1, area2)"

 - Approved-By:

   Used by responsible maintainers or global maintainers when a patch is
   ready to be upstreamed.  If a patch requires multiple approvals, only
   the last reviewer should use this tag, making it obvious to the
   contributor that the patch is ready to be pushed.
   This trailer can be specific to one or more areas of the project, as
   defined by the "Responsible maintainers" section of this file.  If
   that is the case, the area(s) should be added at the end of the tag in
   parenthesis in a comma separated list.  Patches must have all areas
   approved before being pushed.  If a patch has had some areas approved,
   it is recommended that the final approver makes it explicit that the
   patch is ready for pushing.
   Responsible, Global and Official FSF-appointed maintainers may approve
   their own patches, but it is recommended that they seek external approval
   before doing so.

   Usage: "Approved-By: Your Name <your@email>"

 - Co-Authored-By:

   Used when the commit includes meaningful contributions from multiple people.

   Usage: "Co-Authored-By: Contributor's Name <their@email>"

 - Bug:

   This trailer is added with a link to the GDB bug tracker bug for
   added context on relevant commits.

   Usage: "Bug: <link>"

Sometimes, contributors may request small changes, such as fixing typos, before
granting the review or approval trailer. When the contributor thinks that
these changes are so small that it isn't necessary to send a new version, they
may add some text like "with these changes, I'm ok with the patch", followed by
their trailer.  In those situations, the trailer is only valid after the
changes are made.


			The Obvious Fix Rule
			--------------------

All maintainers listed in this file, including the Write After Approval
developers, are allowed to check in obvious fixes.

An "obvious fix" means that there is no possibility that anyone will
disagree with the change.

A good mental test is "will the person who hates my work the most be
able to find fault with the change" - if so, then it's not obvious and
needs to be posted first. :-)

Something like changing or bypassing an interface is _not_ an obvious
fix, since such a change without discussion will result in
instantaneous and loud complaints.

For documentation changes, about the only kind of fix that is obvious
is correction of a typo or bad English usage.


	     The Official FSF-appointed GDB Maintainers
	     ------------------------------------------

These maintainers as a group have final authority for all GDB-related
topics; they may make whatever changes that they deem necessary, or
that the FSF requests.

The current official FSF-appointed GDB maintainers are listed below,
in alphabetical order.  Their affiliations are provided for reference
only - their maintainership status is individual and not through their
affiliation, and they act on behalf of the GNU project.

       Pedro Alves
       Joel Brobecker (AdaCore)
       Doug Evans (Google)
       Eli Zaretskii

		  Global Maintainers
		  ------------------

The global maintainers may review and commit any change to GDB, except in
areas with a Responsible Maintainer available.  For major changes, or
changes to areas with other active developers, global maintainers are
strongly encouraged to post their own patches for feedback before
committing.

The global maintainers are responsible for reviewing patches to any area
for which no Responsible Maintainer is listed.

Global maintainers also have the authority to revert patches which should
not have been applied, e.g. patches which were not approved, controversial
patches committed under the Obvious Fix Rule, patches with important bugs
that can't be immediately fixed, or patches which go against an accepted and
documented roadmap for GDB development.  Any global maintainer may request
the reversion of a patch.  If no global maintainer, or responsible
maintainer in the affected areas, supports the patch (except for the
maintainer who originally committed it), then after 48 hours the maintainer
who called for the reversion may revert the patch.

No one may reapply a reverted patch without the agreement of the maintainer
who reverted it, or bringing the issue to the official FSF-appointed
GDB maintainers for discussion.

At the moment there are no documented roadmaps for GDB development; in the
future, if there are, a reference to the list will be included here.

The current global maintainers are (in alphabetical order):

Pedro Alves			pedro@palves.net
John Baldwin			jhb@freebsd.org
Kevin Buettner			kevinb@redhat.com
Andrew Burgess			aburgess@redhat.com
Luis Machado			luis.machado@arm.com
Simon Marchi			simon.marchi@polymtl.ca
Tom Tromey			tom@tromey.com
Tom de Vries			tdevries@suse.de
Ulrich Weigand			Ulrich.Weigand@de.ibm.com
Eli Zaretskii			eliz@gnu.org


			Release Manager
			---------------

The current release manager is: Joel Brobecker  <brobecker@adacore.com>

His responsibilities are:

    * organizing, scheduling, and managing releases of GDB.

    * deciding the approval and commit policies for release branches,
      and can change them as needed.



			Patch Champions
			---------------

These volunteers track all patches submitted to the gdb-patches list.  They
endeavor to prevent any posted patch from being overlooked; work with
contributors to meet GDB's coding style and general requirements, along with
FSF copyright assignments; remind (ping) responsible maintainers to review
patches; and ensure that contributors are given credit.

Current patch champions (in alphabetical order):

	<none>


			Responsible Maintainers
			-----------------------

These developers have agreed to review patches in specific areas of GDB, in
which they have knowledge and experience.  These areas are generally broad;
the role of a responsible maintainer is to provide coherent and cohesive
structure within their area of GDB, to assure that patches from many
different contributors all work together for the best results.

Global maintainers will defer to responsible maintainers within their areas,
as long as the responsible maintainer is active.  Active means that
responsible maintainers agree to review submitted patches in their area
promptly; patches and followups should generally be answered within a week.
If a responsible maintainer is interested in reviewing a patch but will not
have time within a week of posting, the maintainer should send an
acknowledgement of the patch to the gdb-patches mailing list, and
plan to follow up with a review within a month.  These deadlines are for
initial responses to a patch - if the maintainer has suggestions
or questions, it may take an extended discussion before the patch
is ready to commit.  There are no written requirements for discussion,
but maintainers are asked to be responsive.

If a responsible maintainer misses these deadlines occasionally (e.g.
vacation or unexpected workload), it's not a disaster - any global
maintainer may step in to review the patch.  But sometimes life intervenes
more permanently, and a maintainer may no longer have time for these duties.
When this happens, he or she should step down (either into the Authorized
Committers section if still interested in the area, or simply removed from
the list of Responsible Maintainers if not).

If a responsible maintainer is unresponsive for an extended period of time
without stepping down, please contact the Global Maintainers; they will try
to contact the maintainer directly and fix the problem - potentially by
removing that maintainer from their listed position.

If there are several maintainers for a given domain then any one of them
may review a submitted patch.

Target Instruction Set Architectures:

The *-tdep.c files.  ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and OS-ABI
(Operating System / Application Binary Interface) issues including CPU
variants.

The Target/Architecture maintainer works with the host maintainer when
resolving build issues.  The Target/Architecture maintainer works with
the native maintainer when resolving ABI issues.

The Bourne shell script gdb_mbuild.sh can be used to rebuild all the
above targets.


Host/Native:

The Native maintainer is responsible for target specific native
support - typically shared libraries and quirks to procfs/ptrace/...
The Native maintainer works with the Arch and Core maintainers when
resolving more generic problems.

The host maintainer ensures that gdb can be built as a cross debugger on
their platform.

		Authorized Committers
		---------------------

These are developers working on particular areas of GDB, who are trusted to
commit their own (or other developers') patches in those areas without
further review from a Global Maintainer or Responsible Maintainer.  They are
under no obligation to review posted patches - but, of course, are invited
to do so!
