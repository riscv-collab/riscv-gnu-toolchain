# tests to cover evaluate_subexp_standard with the EVAL_SKIP flag set.
# this happens for instance when there is short circuit evaluation in the && and ||
# operators, or in the non returned part of a (x ? y: z) expression.
# the part that is not evaluated is parsed and evaluated anyway, but with
# the EVAL_SKIP flag set

# Check to see if we have an executable to test.  If not, then either we
# haven't tried to compile one, or the compilation failed for some reason.
# In either case, just notify the user and skip the tests in this file.
