# The doco makes reference to built-in registers -- $pc and $fp.  If
# the ISA contains registers by that name then they should be
# displayed.  If the ISA contains registers identified as being
# equivalent, but have different names, then GDB will provide these as
# aliases.  If the ISA doesn't provide any equivalent registers, then
# GDB will provide registers that map onto the frame's PC and FP.
