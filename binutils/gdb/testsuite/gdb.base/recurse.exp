# The allow_hw_watchpoint_tests checks if watchpoints are supported by the
# processor.  On PowerPC, the check runs a small test program under gdb
# to determine if the Power processor supports HW watchpoints.  The check
# must be done before starting the test so as to not disrupt the execution
# of the actual test.

	# target until the value of the watched variable changes.  If you
	# are single-stepping, you will eventually step into an epilogue.
	# When you do that, the "top" stack frame may become partially
	# deconstructed (as when you pop the frame pointer, for instance),
	# and from that point on, GDB can no longer make sense of the stack.
	# 
	# A test which stops in the epilogue is trying to determine when GDB
	# leaves the stack frame in which the watchpoint was created.  It does
	# this basically by watching for the frame pointer to change.  When
	# the frame pointer changes, the test expects to be back in main, but
