# Test passing bad files to gdb.  PR symtab/17911

# Note: While we test for specific text in error messages,
# thus perhaps making the test host specific, if your host
# print different text then the plan is to update the expected text
# instead of making this test linux-only or some such.

# The pathnames and shell commands in this test don't work on Windows host.

# There is no such file, but we still use the normal mechanism to pick
