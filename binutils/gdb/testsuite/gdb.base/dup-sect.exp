# Test inappropriate offseting of multiple sections with the same name.
# When kept in object file (before final executable link) it still works.
# When separate debug info file is not used it still works.
# When the ELF symbol table is kept in the main binary it still works.
# Used .S file as in .c file we would need __attriute__((section)) which is
# a GCC extension.

# This test can only be run on targets which support ELF and use gas.
# For now pick a sampling of likely targets.
