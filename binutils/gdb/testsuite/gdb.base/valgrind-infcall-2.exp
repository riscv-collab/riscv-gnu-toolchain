# ==31595== Memcheck, a memory error detector
# ==31595== Command: /usr/bin/sleep 10000
# ==31595==
# $ gdb /usr/bin/sleep
# (gdb) target remote | vgdb --pid=31595
# Remote debugging using | vgdb --pid=31595
#   ...

# (gdb) p printf ("bla")
# terminate called after throwing an instance of 'gdb_exception_error'
# Aborted (core dumped)
