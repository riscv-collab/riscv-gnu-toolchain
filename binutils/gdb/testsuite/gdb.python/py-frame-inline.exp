# A regression test for having a backtrace limit that forces unwinding
# to stop after an inline frame.  GDB needs to compute the frame_id of
# the inline frame, which requires unwinding past all the inline
# frames to the real stack frame, even if that means bypassing the
# user visible backtrace limit.  See PR backtrace/15558.
#
# Set the limit, and run to an inline function.  It's important that
# the frame cache is flushed somehow after setting the limit, to force
# frame id recomputation.
