# When gdb resolves type information for class "derived" from objfile
# gdb2384, it use to fill in the TYPE_VPTR_BASETYPE field with class "base"
# from objfile gdb2384-base.so.  When the program is rerun the type
# information for base-in-so-base.so is discarded leaving
# TYPE_VPTR_BASETYPE dangling.
