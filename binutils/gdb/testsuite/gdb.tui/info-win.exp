# As the tuiterm.exp library just waits for the prompt and command to
# be echo'ed bcak to the screen, multiple 'info win' calls like this
# have a problem.  Dejagnu will send the command to gdb, but will then
# immediately see the '(gdb) info win' output from the first use
# above.  This means we end up rushing ahead, and some tests might
# fail.
#
# To work around this, I'm sending a unique command 'p 1' here, that
# only happens after the second 'info win' call.  When the 'p 1'
# completes, I know the second 'info win' has also completed.
