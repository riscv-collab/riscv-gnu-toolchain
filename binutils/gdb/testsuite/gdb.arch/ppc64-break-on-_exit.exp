# Set a breakpoint on a local copy of glibc's _exit, and verify that it
# triggers.  The function does a syscall immediately after the prologue, and
# if the breakpoint is set past the syscall due to faulty prologue skipping,
# the breakpoint will not trigger.
#
# In particular, we're trying to excercise the instruction analysis
# functionality of prologue skipping.  If non-minimal symbols are
# read, then that functionality might not be used because f.i.
# line-info is used instead.  So, we use nodebug.
