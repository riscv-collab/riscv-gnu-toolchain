# These tests provides certain degree of testing for arc_insn functions,
# however it is not a comprehensive testsuite that would go through all
# possible ARC instructions - instead this particular test is focused on branch
# instructions and whether branch targets are evaluated properly.  Most of the
# non-branch aspects of instruction decoder are used during prologue analysis,
# so are indirictly tested there.

# To maintain separation of test data and test logic, all of the information
# about instructions, like if it has delay slot, condition code, branch target
# address, is all specified in the test assembly file as a symbols, while this
# test case reads those symbols to learn which values are right, then compares
# values coming from decoder with those found in symbols.  More information
# about requirements to actual test cases can be found in corresponding
# assembly file of this test case (arc-decode-insn.S).
