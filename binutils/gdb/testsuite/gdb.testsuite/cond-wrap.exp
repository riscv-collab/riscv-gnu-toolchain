# The purpose of this test-case is to test the cond_wrap proc.

# Proc that temporarily sets global variable a to 6, and executes BODY.
# Note that normally a wrapper needs to guarantee that the restore is executed
# even if executing body throws an error, but we don't need to bother with this
# for this test-case.

    # Restore a.
    set a $save_a
}

# Set initial value of global variable a.
set a 5

# Verify values of global variable a for cond == 0 and cond == 1.
