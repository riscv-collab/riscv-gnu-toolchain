# Test GDB can cope with Fortran strings having their length present in a CPU
# register.  With -O0 the string length is passed on the stack.  To make this
# test meaningful the follow assertion should pass.  It is not being checked
# here as the "_s" symbol is compiler dependent:
#   (gdb) info address _s
#   Symbol "_s" is a variable in register XX.
