# main.c                                         5    func_start
# other.c                                        1    func0
# 	`inlined' called at main.c line 8
# main.c                                         9    func1
# 	func1 = Breakpoint location 1
# other.c                                        1    func2
# 	`inlined2' called at main.c line 11
# main.c                                         9    func3
# 	func3 = Breakpoint location 2
# 	`otherinline' called at main.c line 9
# end of main                                         func_end
