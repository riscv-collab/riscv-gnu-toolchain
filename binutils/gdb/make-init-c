# Generate the init.c source file.

# Usage:
#
#    ./make-init-c source-files > init.c-tmp
#
# Where SOURCE-FILES is the list of source files to extract init functions from.
#
# Formatting conventions:  The name of the initialization routines must begin
# with `_initialize_`, must start in column zero, and be followed with exactly
# ` ()`.  For example:
#
# void
# _initialize_foo ()
# {
#   ...
# }

# Abort on command error.
