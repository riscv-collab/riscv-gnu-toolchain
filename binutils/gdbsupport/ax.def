/* The actual values of the various bytecode operations.

   Other independent implementations of the agent bytecode engine will
   rely on the exact values of these enums, and may not be recompiled
   when we change this table.  The numeric values should remain fixed
   whenever possible.  Thus, we assign them values explicitly here (to
   allow gaps to form safely), and the disassembly table in
   agentexpr.h behaves like an opcode map.  If you want to see them
   grouped logically, see doc/agentexpr.texi.

   Each line is of the form:
   
   DEFOP (name, size, data_size, consumed, produced, opcode)
   
   NAME is the name of the operation.
   SIZE is the number of argument bytes that the operation takes from
   the bytecode stream.
   DATA_SIZE is the size of data operated on, in bits, for operations
   that care (ref and const).  It is zero otherwise.
   CONSUMED is the number of stack elements consumed.
   PRODUCED is the number of stack elements produced.
   OPCODE is the operation's encoding.  */
